between the brief of 1604 and the elaborate treatise of 1625,
it has been decided not to prefix a special introduction to any
of the three works in question, but to issue at a later date, in
separate form, a general introduction to the three.

The edition of De jure belli ac pacis which has been photo-
graphically reproduced is that of 1646, which appeared the year
after the death of the illustrious author. It has been chosen
for reproduction because of Ompteda’s statement, in his Lit-
teratur des Vblkerreclzts, part 11, page 394, that this edition has
been faithfully followed by all subsequent ones. The size of
the page has been slightly increased, and the text as repro-
duced is therefore a little larges than that of the original.

Notes and comments of a critical kind have not been sup-
plied and no lists of misprints or corrections of errors in the
body of the work have been appended, as a critical edition of
the text is contemplated.

The portrait of Grotius prefixed to the text is a reproduc·
tion of the well-known engraving by Delff after Mierevelt's
painting‚ done when the distinguished publicist was forty·nine

years of age.
