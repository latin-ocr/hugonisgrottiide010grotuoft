The works of Grotius dealing with the subject of inter-
national law, which are to be reproduced in this series of the
Classics, are three in number:

First. De jure praedae commentarius, written in [604-5, appar-
ently as a brief in a case in which Grotius was retained as
counsel, discovered in 1864, and first published as a whole
in 1868 from Grotius' own manuscript, which is now in the
possession of the University of Leyden. The manuscript will
be photographed and will precede a careful reprint of the
original text.

Second. The Mare liberum, sive dejure quod Batavis competit
ad indicana commercia dissertatio, forming Chapter XII of the legal
brief De jure praedoe, published separately in the year 1609.

Third. The masterpiece entitled De jure belli ac pacis libri
tres, published for the first time in 1625.

It was'originally intended to prefix an elaborate introduction
to the present photographic reissue of the three books on the
Rights of War and Peace, but it was thought to be inexpedient
to increase the size of the volume in such a way as to make it
unwieldy‚ as would necessarily be the case if the introduction
were of adequate length.

There is, however, a much stronger reason against prefixing
the introduction to the present volume, namely, the advisa-
bility of pointing out the relation which exists between the
lawyer’s brief of 1604 and the philosopher's masterpiece of
1625. It is believed that this can best be done, as far as the
general reader is concerned, after the three works in question
shall have been published and a translation made of the brief
of 1604, which has not hitherto appeared in English.

In view, therefore, of the length of the introduction which
would have to show the relation in which Grotius stood to his
predecessors and the influence in general which his writings
have exercised upon the development of international law,
and in view, further, of the close connection which exists
